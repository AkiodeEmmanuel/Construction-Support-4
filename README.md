# Alternative Crude Oil Export (ACOE) - Forcados Shell Field, Nigeria

## Project Overview
The Alternative Crude Oil Export (ACOE) project at the Forcados Shell Field involved the installation of a Tri-Catenary Mooring System and ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) inspections. The operations demanded accurate surface and subsea positioning to ensure precision in the deployment and monitoring of infrastructure.

## Project Details
- **Date:** March 2023 â€“ April 2023  
- **Scope:** ROV Inspection, Tri-Catenary Mooring System Installation  
- **Project Role:** Online Surveyor
- **Project Location**: Forcados Shell Field
- **Client**: Shell Nigeria Limited
- **Contractor:** Centurty port Nigeria Limited

## Responsibilities

- Continuously monitored and validated the accuracy of surface and subsea positioning data, ensuring all measurements were precise and met project specifications.
-  Recorded all significant events during the installation and inspection process, including mooring system deployment and ROV activities, ensuring accurate logs for reporting and future reference.
-  Coordinated with the ROV team, offshore engineers, and dive teams to ensure that all survey requirements were understood and met, particularly for positioning and touchdown monitoring during subsea operations.
-  Merged and analyzed real-time data from various sources (e.g., DGPS, Gyro, USBL) to create integrated datasets that supported the ROV and subsea operations.
-  Identified and addressed any technical issues with positioning equipment or software, ensuring minimal disruption to operations and maintaining accurate data flow.
-  Produced detailed daily and final survey reports summarizing positioning tasks, system performance, and any anomalies encountered during operations.
-  Ensured that all survey equipment, including DGPS, Gyro, and USBL systems, were regularly calibrated and maintained to guarantee high-accuracy data collection throughout the project..
